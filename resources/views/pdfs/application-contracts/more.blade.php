    <p>For Customers whose kilowatt-demand is estimated to reach at least 15 kilowatts based on their submitted electrical plans, their bill deposit shall be computed based on the following formula:</p>

    <div class="formula">
        <strong>Bill Deposit = (Demand x 8760 x Load Factor) / 12 x Current Rate</strong>
    </div>

    <p>Provided that, for all classes of Customers, should their respective monthly bills, after 12 months, show an average billing that is more than the estimated amount based on their load or service wire size, then their respective deposit/s shall be correspondingly increased to approximate their average monthly billing. Such deposit shall guarantee the prompt payment of Customer's bills or of his lessee or occupants. In case of delay or failure of payment, MORE reserves the right to apply the said deposit or so much thereof to the balance of account without prejudice to other legal remedies which MORE may have against the Customer for the collection of the delinquency. In case MORE is constrained to utilize the deposit of a Customer, such customer shall immediately replenish its deposit as a condition to continued electric service by MORE.</p>
